# In order to find the strength of indirect relations between the driving factors the FDRM needs go through the stabilisation process. It 
consists in a matrix multiplication process using max-min fuzzy composition. The process is guided by the following rule: 
  T=μ_RoS=maxn⁡[min⁡(μ_R (x,n),μ_S (n,y)]
  Where, R = Xin and S = Ynj.
