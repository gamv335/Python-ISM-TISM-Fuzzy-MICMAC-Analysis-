# Python-ISM-TISM-Fuzzy-MICMAC-Analysis-
TISM allows the development of a hierarchical structure of a determined set of variables from a directed graph approach. 
While the TISM methodology was useful to develop an interpretive model of the relationship between the driving forces, it does not bring forward considerations about the strength or relevance of the elements and their relationships. To overcome this limitation, a fuzzy MICMAC analysis could be conducted.
